# Political Analysis Report Generator

## Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application that generates detailed political analysis reports for a given politician. The system extracts data, enhances the report using AI, generates charts, and compiles the information into a downloadable PDF or text file.

## Features
- Accepts a politician's name and a date range as input.
- Uses AI (Claude and Groq API) to gather and enhance report data.
- Generates visual charts for key data points.
- Converts the report into a downloadable PDF.
- Allows users to check report generation status.
- Provides real-time logs of the processing steps.

## Requirements
### Prerequisites
